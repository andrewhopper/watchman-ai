# Requirements for Watchman AI Command-Line Validation Tool

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements for the Watchman AI Command-Line Validation Tool, which is designed to enforce rules, specifications, and standards in AI coding environments.

## Requirements

### 1. Input Handling
- **Description:** The tool must accept a set of validation criteria via command-line arguments or a configuration file.
- **Purpose:** To provide flexibility in how users specify validation criteria.
- **Constraints:** Must support common configuration file formats such as JSON or YAML.

### 2. Validation Processing
- **Description:** The tool must process the validation criteria using the Agno framework.
- **Purpose:** To leverage the Agno framework's capabilities for efficient validation.
- **Constraints:** Must handle large sets of criteria without performance degradation.

### 3. Report Generation
- **Description:** The tool must generate a detailed validation report summarizing the results, including any errors or warnings.
- **Purpose:** To provide users with clear feedback on the validation process.
- **Constraints:** Reports must be generated in a user-friendly format, such as JSON or plain text.

## Future Considerations
- **Expansion:** Plan for future expansion into an MCP server, VS Code plugin, or daemon for real-time validation.
- **Scalability:** Design the tool to handle large sets of validation criteria efficiently.
